# OpenGLTut

This repository contains a series of simple OpenGL programs and experiments intended to demonstrate the fundamentals of modern OpenGL (version 3.3+). The goal is to provide clear, minimal examples for learning and experimenting with OpenGL concepts using C++.

## Features

- Basic OpenGL window creation (GLFW + GLEW)
- Rendering primitives (triangles, rectangles)
- Shader compilation and usage
- VAOs, VBOs, and EBOs
- Input handling (keyboard and mouse)
- Basic transformations (translation, rotation, scaling)
